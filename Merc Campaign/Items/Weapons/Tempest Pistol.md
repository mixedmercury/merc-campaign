A simple flintlock pistol formerly belonging to [[Scalebeard Salk]]. The pistol is marked with etchings of the ocean's waves. As he said in his life, he kept his secrets "between him and the sea". It was enchanted by Salk with three distinct forms of magic. The first reveals markings hidden on papers drafted by Salk. The second was the key to unlock the entrance of his hideout on [[Mintarn]]. The third gave the weapon's attacks its magical properties.

The hammer of this flintlock pistol sparks and crackles with electricity. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, you deal an additional 1d8 lightning damage. This weapon has 8 charges. You can spend 1 charge when you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon; if you do, the target canâ€™t use reactions until the end of your next turn.

While wielding it, you can use an action to expend charges to cast the following spells: gust of wind (1 charge) or  lightning bolt (2 charges). The spell save DC for these spells is 16. The pistol regains 2d4 expended charges each day at dawn.
