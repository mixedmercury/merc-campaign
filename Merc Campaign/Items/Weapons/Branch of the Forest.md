Rare Staff (Requires attunement by a Druid)
Damage: 1d6 (1d8 versatile) + 1
Damage Type: Bludgeoning
Properties: Versatile 
Weight: 4

Originally found in the Underdark as the Twig of the Grove, it has since grown in its size and magical capabilities under the care of Ver-Ik. It was much larger when first seen wielded by a Kuo-toa priest until it was mostly destroyed by the giant purple worm of their creation.

It is mildly sentient and is capable of holding the concentration of the spells it casts for its wielder. 

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 6 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.

Spells

You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:

Animal friendship (1 charge)
Barkskin (2 charges)
Locate animals or plants (2 charges)
Speak with animals (1 charge)
Speak with plants (3 charges)
