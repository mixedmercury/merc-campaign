Wondrous item, Rare 

A long flowing robe gifted to Walks by their mother. It is a well made robe whose clasp is adorned with the seal of Clan Mountain Sound.

**Useful Things:** The robe is able to produce any item from any of its pockets when asked, as long as the item is not worth more than 10 gold pieces and are the right size/shape to be pulled out of the pocket.

The robe has an unknown number of inhabitants living inside of it. They have taken to a semi-hostile relationship with Walks, often sarcastically delivering handwritten notes with the requested items insulting its wearer. It will also passive-aggressively give exactly what the wearer asks for in an attempt to spite them. When it is asked for "glue", it may fill its pocket with loose glue when the wearer reaches into its pockets. The wearer, of course, never asked for a jar.

**Living Things:** Living creatures should not be taken out of the jacket, as they will live what is known as a "half-life" and immediately and constantly attempt to kill itself. The wearer can, however, willingly enter the robe's inner environment. If they attempt to leave later, they may suffer the same suicidal fate as summoned creatures.
