• This gold earring has music notes scribed around its entirety. If you hold it up to your ear, you can hear a faint, almost recognizable song whispering from it.

Bard Level 3:  
• As an action, you can play an instrument for up to one minute, granting yourself and allies within a 10' radius around you one of the following benefits. Your allies must be able to hear you, and the song will end early if you are silenced, unconscious, or incapacitated, or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). It requires a Bonus Action to maintain playing a song, and you must maintain concentration as though you were concentrating on a spell. As an action, you may switch the song you are playing, but you do not gain any additional playing time. After playing a song in this fashion (even if you end it early), you must take a Short or Long Rest before playing a song in this fashion again.

§ Your allies gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your CHA modifier (minimum of +1).

○ Song of Denial:  
§ Your aura turns enemies away. They must pass a WIS save against your Spell DC or be unable to enter your aura.
