[[Session 18 - Sundabar 12-30-2023]]

Walks poses as their brother to go to the auction with Vahn as their guest while Ebon and Ver-Ik search for Fast's kidnappers. 

Walks and Vahn are accepted into the auction. They see [[Liraac]], a blue dragonborn commanding the kobolds. Vahn makes an attempt to unnerve her and plant dragon scales on those who he wants her to be suspicious of, but it does not succeed. They also meet a strange hag in attendance of the auction who seemed to have a pension for creating strange animal hybrids.

Back in the city, Ver-Ik uses his tracking skills to follow the trail left by [[Fast to Run]]'s kidnappers with Ebon. They come to a shady part of town, finding the trail ends at a locked tavern. The place is entirely empty. Ebon breaks into the tavern, narrowly avoiding being noticed. The two scramble around to find where the trail leads to. Ver-Ik finds that it ends at a fireplace marked with an emblem of a dragon's head. Ebon rummages through the lockbox and the bottles of booze, taking most of what he can get his hands on. When moving a bottle of dragon fire whiskey with a sculpted head of a dragon on the stopper, the fireplace slides open to reveal a hidden passage.

The two descend to find a bloody massacre. The room is a hideout for the thieves' guild, but all they find are their dead bodies. Most of the bodies seem to have symbols of Cyric on them. Not left by the cult, but the belongings of the thieves. While Cyric worship was uncommon, it was mostly found in thieves and outlaws. The kobolds hear something down a hallway and prepare to attack. They charge in and Ebon attacks the first person he sees. The man is eviscerated at the horror of both Ebon and Ver-Ik. The two scramble to heal him as he barely clings to life, Ebon holding his guts into place while Ver-Ik casting healing spells.

They manage to save the man's life. The two men hiding there were survivors of the massacre, describing the attackers as the Cult of Cyric, but they were purging anyone in the guild who worshipped Cyric. Along with the thieves, they find Fast bound and gagged. While trying to help their sibling by getting information, he got careless and the guild caught on to who he was. He was kidnapped with the intention of holding him for ransom. 

 Back with Walks and Vahn, the auction had begun. The items were expensive and luxurious, but they managed to win the ship as Fast was there to do. The strange hag from earlier purchased a nightmare and said something to it about giving it dragon wings before disappearing with it. The key however, ended up being way more money than either Walks or Fast had to spend.

Walks and Vahn confront the representative of the cult that bought the key, threatening him. He says that he is not here alone. They couldn't do anything to him in the auction and as soon as they left, the rest of the cult would be there to protect him if they follow him.
