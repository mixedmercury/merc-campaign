[[Session 21 - Egg 02-10-2024]]

The gang leaves Silverymoon to head for [[Penrith]] with [[Quinn Redhelm]]. On the way, they get stopped by a checkpoint. Walks hides with invisibility while Ver-Ik remains in wild shape. The men confiscate the party's weapons and questions Vahn, Ebon, and Quinn about where they're heading to. Recognizing them from the wanted posters, they start to question about the whereabouts of Walks. They start to realize that the checkpoint is fake and actually set up by bounty hunters that got a tip that the party was heading this way. Vahn tries to act like he is trying to drink a bottle of poison in an attempt to make the bounty hunters think it's a potion to give him power. He drops it on "accident" and scrambles to grab it so that they can try to take it from him. His deception succeeds, however the bounty hunters smash the bottle instead of trying to drink it.

Walks invisibly sneaks into their tent nearby to steal back everyone's weapons. Soon, the hunters become hostile, the leader shifting into his Werebear form to attack. Walks unlocks the chest the weapons were in and Quinn teleports into the tent and back out to get them to everyone. The enemies are swiftly defeated and the crew continues to Penrith.

Quinn tells the party more about [[Darian Redhelm]]. She said he was an academic type and usually very timid. A while ago he left for Candlekeep to continue his studies. More recently he returned, seeming much more bitter and cynical than before. It was a complete change in him and soon after he found himself caught up with the Zhentarim. She then separated from the party to head to Neverwinter when the paths split. 

The party continues through the Mere of Dead Men to Penrith.
