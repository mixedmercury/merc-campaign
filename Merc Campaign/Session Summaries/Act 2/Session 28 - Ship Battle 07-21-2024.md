[[Session 27 - Scalebeard's Treasure 07-01-2024]]

The crew decides to use the Kobold Kanun to launch troops at the second largest ship. Ebon, Walks, and Igni decide to get launched onto the ship while Terra and Ver-Ik stay behind. Ebon and Igni land right on top of enemy troops, while Walks lands in the water. They thankfully didn't have to swim since Ver-Ik cast water walking on the people being launched. 

The ship's main cannons fire on the Chauntea, the ship of the vampirates that the party routed a few days prior. Meanwhile, a third smaller ship attempted to gain on the Sapphire Serpent. On deck of the other ship, Walks managed to see through the invisibility of its mage captain and kill him as he tried to misty step away into the rigging of the ship. Terra sniped a few of the crew impressively with her crossbow. Ver-Ik commanded the [[Scalebeard Pirates]] along with [[Scalebeard Salk]]. The party killed the crew on the deck of the ship before Igni ran below deck and killed the people operating the cannons below deck. Finally, Salk rammed the Chauntea, causing it to begin sinking from the damage caused by the cannons earlier.

The final ship fled from the fight after seeing its allies fall. Ebon gave the last few a chance to surrender before gathering back on the Sapphire Serpent. Drix sunk the ship that was left, partially because they wouldn't have enough crew to sail both, and partially because the kobolds all wanted to see the destruction.
