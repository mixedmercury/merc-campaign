The party finds Benwir in the lower decks of the ship and take him back to the Sapphire Serpent after freeing the other slaves. There they see Sarhala participating in the kobold shenanigans. Ver-Ik and Igni retreat to the med bay and kick out Kraeg. Walks locks Kraeg on the balcony of their room. They spend the night there swaying their tails to the sea shanties together. Ebon shows Terra around the ship and they let Sarhala, Benwir, and Terra all stay the night.

Ebon takes Adderall to remember where he recognizes a symbol that Terra found on the slaver ship. Walks recognizes the symbol from Neverwinter, but doesn't know what it is.

Sarhala and Benwir lead the party to their hideout, a cave in which the only entrance is a small tunnel that only small creatures can fit through.
