[[Session 15 - Escape from Waterdeep 11-18-2024]]

The party arrives at [[Silverymoon]], following Rurem's directions to Sip the Scales. Upon entering they see that the tavern also serves as a gambling hall. They meet the owner, [[Imra (Androm)]] and explain the situation to them. She says she's going to beat Rurem's ass for putting Knak in danger and directs them to the back of the shop. A trapdoor opens, dropping them into the saferoom below. They explore the city for some time, using the time to rest and resupply after having faced a dragon just the day before.

They meet the Harpers stationed in Silverymoon. [[Perkin]] is the first to encounter them outside of the Harper house, loudly asking if they're here for the secret mission. Inside, they meet the halfling [[Wilric]] who was left in charge of the house despite not being a High Harper (or anywhere near it). The Harpers seemed to be underwhelming to say the least, looking to be unprofessional and not as secretive as they should be. 

They tell Wilric about the key they had recovered and he directs them to the basement to meet with [[Unora]], their in-house wizard. They enter the cluttered and chaotic arcane lab to find the disheveled elf at work. She tells them the key is used in the ritual to summon Cyric and that they need to gather more to prevent them from summoning the mad god. She would need one more to properly develop the technology to track the others. They leave for now to wait for more intel to come from the Harpers in the field.
