[[Session 23 - The Scalebeard Pirates 03-30-2024]]

The party makes their way through the Mere of Dead Men to the fishing hole marked on [[Scalebeard Salk]]'s map. Some giant crocodiles are in their way, but are ultimately trivial. Eventually they reach a small shack with a circular pier. Off the edge of it, a single serpentine head hissed at whoever approached. Ebon quickly cut off the head of the beast and began to walk away having killed the beast that killed Salk.

To his surprise, he was quickly snatched up and dragged underwater by another head. Suddenly half a dozen more heads appeared around the swampy fishing pier as the hydra revealed its true nature. Using the longsword of minor flame tongue they managed to deal fire damage to prevent the regeneration of new heads. To help in the fight, Ver-Ik attempted to summon a creature to his aid. A strange antlered duck in a hat appeared, addressing itself as Gerald. It started to attack Ver-Ik with pecks before reluctantly agreeing to help. He quacked, summoning a unicorn. The unicorn Euros, annoyed at being disturbed kicked Ver-Ik before agreeing to help only because the hydra was an evil threat.

The hydra died and Euros huffed before making his exit along with Gerald. Inside its gut, they found the [[Typhoon Pistol]], Salk's pistol engraved with a wave-like design.

The gang returns to [[Penrith]] and shows the gun to Drix to prove they killed the hydra. With the former captain's killer dead, the crew could now leave with Drix as the proper captain (and Walks still calling the shots since they own the ship). They notice a hidden button on the Typhoon Pistol which activates a light. By shining the light on Salk's map they see hidden details, including the location of his treasure on [[Mintarn]]. They plot the course and prepare to head out.

Walks picks up the guns from the craftsman that they ordered and returns the gun they "bought" to the kobold, letting him keep the gold they gave him. Vahn searches for a kobold that could accompany him as his assistant. He first meets Igni, who says she is the ship's doctor and has no interest in working for him. He then shifts focus to Mags, whose eyes widen at the sight of his gold and his promise that there's more where that came from. Mags was added to his inventory.
