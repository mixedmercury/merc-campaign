[[Session 16 - Silverymoon 12-02-2023]]

While wandering the city, Ebon comes across a cervitaur huntress named Yew. She hip checks him and worries that he needs medical attention, so Ebon brings her to the two doctors he knows... in the secret hideout. The party is not thrilled. She does agree to help the party as she has done mercenary work in the past for people.

The party gets called back to the harpers as new information has come up. First of all, their bounty posters have arrived. Walks has the highest bounty with thousands of gold for their capture. Ebon has the lowest at 3 gold.

Aside from that, they have located another key. An underground auction in Sundabar has one of the keys listed on the items for sale. They depart for Sundabar to pursue the lead on the next key.

(There may have been an encounter on the way to Sundabar, I forget.)

Upon arriving in Sundabar the party decides to stay at the upper end hotel that Walks knows from travelling with their father for business. They go to a nearby bathhouse to get clean and presentable enough to be seen there. Walks had to teach the kobolds how to use soap and to not eat it.

Walks tries to talk to the thieves' guild of Sundabar to try to get help with robbing the auction. They decline, saying that they don't want to anger the host of the auction and that breaking into the venue would be extremely difficult. The amount of money they'd need to be hired for such a job would be more than they could afford even if they could find the crew for it.
