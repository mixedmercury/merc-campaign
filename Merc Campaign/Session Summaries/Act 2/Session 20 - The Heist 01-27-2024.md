[[Session 19 - The Auction 01-13-2024]]

Following the auction, Vahn and Walks return to where they found one of the cultists from before. They poison him in his sleep using a syringe too small to notice and steal his portion of the money for the key.

The next day, Walks posing as Fast returns to the auction house to claim the title for the boat. They are told it is in a town on the coast of the Mere of Dead Men called [[Penrith]]. They regroup and plot to break in to steal the key before the cult retrieves it. They paint Ebon blue and fit Walks and Ver-Ik into their bag of holding. Vahn creates a distraction outside by making a kobold yip (strictly forbidden by [[Liraac]]) while Ebon sneaks in. Using the kobolds' fear of Liraac, Ebon successfully tricks the kobold inside into letting him into the vault to retrieve an object for a patron. 

When inside the vault, they begin to look through the chests in search for the key. Half the chests turn out to be trained mimics. After fighting them off and finding the key, Walks and Ver-Ik crawl back into the bag while Ebon gets the kobold outside to let them out. The vault was thick enough to keep the sounds of fighting from getting outside. They leave and regroup with Vahn before quickly escaping town before anyone notices.\

On the way back, they encounter Svendor the Magnificent. He offers to sell scrolls that he claims are the much better alternative to the wands that his rival Derchant the Incredible sells. Everyone declines, thinking his wares were overpriced before his cart vanishes in a puff of annoyed smoke. 

They all continue back to Silverymoon together.
