[[Session 25 - Mintarn 04-20-2024]]

Terra tells the party that the people on the ship tended to stay on board during the day. At night, most would leave to enjoy the town. If they were trying to infiltrate, then going at night would be best. The gang agrees that being silent would be best, but that would be hard with the clumsy ball of metal that is Ebon. Igni hears the conversation and offers to accompany them, telling them that she can cast silence if that would help.

The party leaves Sarhala at the ship and goes at night to sneak on board with Terra and Igni. On the deck of the ship, a ghoul and a pale man are on deck. The ghoul was moving around some crates. Walks scales the back of the ship to sneak into the captain's quarters, which seemed to be hardly used. Igni cast silence and they quickly dealt with the creatures on deck. They see upon closer investigation that the man is a vampire spawn. They descend under the deck.

Underneath, there were multiple coffins. They see one that is in the center and more regal than the rest. Still affected by silence, they sneak up to it and start to attack. The spawn are dealt with swiftly, the lord getting attacked soon after. He screams while magically silenced, before soon retreating to the bottom of the ship.

The lowest level of the ship held the slaves. The vampire drained one of them to recover health, and used ghouls and swarms of rats to help defend himself. The party slays him quickly however, rescuing the remaining slaves including Benwir.
