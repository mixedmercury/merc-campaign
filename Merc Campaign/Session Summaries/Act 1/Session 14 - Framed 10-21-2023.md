[[Session 13 - Skullport 09-30-2023]]

Arriving back in Waterdeep, the party returns to the Redhelm manor to update [[Lord Redhelm]] about what happened in Skullport. Quinn decides to leave to deal with other business she had to attend to, not telling the others what it was. Rhys and Ver-Ik wander off to explore the manor (Ver-Ik mostly going to keep Rhys out of trouble) while Walks, Vahn, and Skoddit go to the main audience chamber to talk to the lord.

Lord Redhelm dismisses his guards from the room as he did before, wanting their conversation to be kept private. The doors shut and the party informed him that his son had been teleported away by a powerful mage that accompanied him. Suddenly, an arrow flew from one of the high windows of the room! It pierced the lord in the heart before petrifying his body into stone. The figure in the window ran, the party attempting to stop him quickly. 

The commotion brought the guards back into the room. Seeing their now dead lord and no one else in the room, they believed the party to be the culprits. The guards called in more and swiftly arrested everyone in the room. Vahn attempted to use the Tin Man's Oil Can from Avaris' lair (that the DM forgot about) to cure his petrification. Almost as if on cue a scroll tied to the arrow ignited, causing Lord Redhelm's stone body to explode. Ver-Ik attempted to make an escape with Rhys by turning into a giant wolf spider, however they managed to capture them still.

The party was escorted to the prison cells underneath the city.
