[[Session 3 - Robbery at the Festival 06-24-2023]]

The party wakes up, some more hungover than others, and Walks decides to go to the local magic item shop to try to find some equipment. They go in to find that the owner is none other than the [[Elf Woman]] that they tried to pickpocket not once, but twice. The shopkeeper, unable to prove Walks' guilt, instead asks exorbitant prices to get them to leave. Walks tells Vahn about this and asks them to go in their stead to buy what they needed.

Vahn makes a very different choice.

He recruits Rhys for his willingness to do anything for shinies, Ver-Ik for his general disregard of the law, and Skoddit because he's racist.

Together they hatch a plan to rob this woman blind. Walks of course is not involved. They just so happened to be playing a board game with some of the guards. They were doing so well at the game, that all the guards became invested, giving them all of their attention instead of keeping an eye out for oh, you know, robberies.

While Vahn was posing as a customer, Ver-Ik in wild shape snuck inside with Rhys and Skoddit. Vahn created a phantasm of a tabaxi thief in the upstairs room. They locked the elf woman in the upstairs room with what she believed to be a real thief. Meanwhile the real thieves downstairs shoved whatever they could into their bags. Again, Walks was NOT THERE. The guards just so happened to not notice any of this because of the incredible game of magic checkers or whatever Walks was involved in.

The gang wraps up their thievery as they hear screams of "MOMMY THERE'S NOTHING THERE" and "MOMMY YOU'RE SCARING ME!" coming from upstairs.

They meet back up with Walks because they were not present at the robbery. They then distribute the loot from the robbery to Walks. Benefitting from a robbery that your friends committed does not make you an accomplice though of course. 

Everyone chooses to stay in town for a minute because leaving immediately would draw attention to themselves, and they decide to leave in the morning.

The party departs from [[Secomber]] with [[Clovis Langham]] to find the woman who cursed his town. On the way they get attacked by a group of scarecrows and swarms of ravens. Ver-Ik gets carried off and they accidentally set a fire in the field they were in, but they manage to defeat the enemies and put out the fires.

The party stops in Uluvin, an otherwise unimportant crossroads town, for the night. Walks begins to realize they can hear the voices of ghosts while staying at Where the Maiden Dances and sees its namesake spirit. When asked to prove it, they have a ghost reveal secret information about Ver-Ik that it had seen. It said that his scales were a strange color ~~and that he is absolutely PACKING~~.

The party continues the next day to follow the signs posted to the abandoned dwarven keep where they'll find the woman they're looking for (I forget how they found out where they needed to go, but they did).
