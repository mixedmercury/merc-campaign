[[Session 1 - Secomber 06-10-2023]]

After seeing the horrors of Greenbourne, Elq leaves the party, taking his clingy cursed sword with him. The party levels up to level 2.

The party arrives at the [[Feux Volant Meadery]] to find that is has been overrun by goblins. Two stand watch on the second floor balcony, shooting at the party as they approach. Some of the party scales the wall, while some enter on the ground floor, immediately splitting the party. Vahn, Skoddit, and Ver-Ik climb to the second floor, Rhys enters through the front door, and Walks sneaks around the back.

Starting at the top floor, the three discover the goblin boss sleeping in his bed. Vahn immediately grabs him by the neck. The boss calls out, causing more goblins to rush into the room. Negotiation attempts happen for a while.

Downstairs, Walks fails to sneak into the house through the back door. They are immediately noticed and run like hell to protect their 14 hp. Rhys on the other hand, discovers a few wasted goblins lying around. He goes into a rage and begins his slaughter. The tiny otter barbarian proceeds to singlehandedly tear apart multiple goblins with his bare paws. 

Negotiations don't go well, but the goblins at least agree to not attack. They say they just want the owner, [[Jerome Vinger]]. They refuse to allow the players to retrieve any of his belongings, including the requested mead, until they have him. Knowing that tracking him down would take too long, they do not agree. Vahn summons boss music in-universe, then dances around the room to taunt the goblin boss. The party succeeds in routing the goblins because Walks is *so good at killing!*. In the bedroom they find a journal in the footlocker and note on the goblin boss' body that says "Vinger knows what he owes. Get him to pay." The note is stamped with the symbol of the [[Zhentarim]].

The journal reveals that the bees went missing from the meadery six weeks ago. After two weeks, Jerome released his staff, and after four, Jerome's wife [[Lucille Vinger]] went north up Unicorn Run to try to find where they all left to. The last entry is from three days ago, where Jerome says he is leaving to find his wife.

Searching through the grounds, they find a [[Dagger of Venom]], a bee statuette, and the ledger in Jerome's office.

In the basement there are countless barrels of mead along with two goblins. One is freaking the FUCK out, saying things like "the walls are melting". The party finds the barrel he drank from is marked with a chevron that the others are not. While investigating, the players also find a larger bee statue that very closely matches the smaller one from the office. It appears to be missing its stinger. When the players insert the dagger of venom into the statue, a secret panel in the wall slides open.

The party is now level 3.
