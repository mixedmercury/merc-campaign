[[Session 9 - Return to Secomber 08-19-2023]]

The party begins their journey to Waterdeep. Upon arrival they choose to make their way to the shopping district where they find the two main stores are Gnome Depot and Quest Buy, selling mundane and magical items respectively. While pickpocketing the people in the street around, Walks snagged a Quest Buy nametag bearing the name of the [[Elf Woman]]. They promptly destroyed it.

After seeing the prices of goods, the party splits up to make some money. Vahn performs some, Walks pickpockets obviously, and Rhys does tricks with [[Mr. Bitey]]. Skoddit decides to take up a mining contract with [[Mountain Sound Mining Company]]. He descends into the Underdark with three other dwarves, fighting bug monsters along the way. Despite all the other dwarves dying, the mission was a success and they were all okay.

Ver-Ik decides to go check out a defunct and abandoned home goods store, Bed Beholders & Beyond. It was one of Xanathar's more ambitious endeavors, though clearly it did not work out very well after too many customers got lost in the "Beyond" section. The building was full of fine bedding and bath products, as well as a portal labeled "Beyond". Ver-Ik tossed some care items through the portal, hoping they reached whoever was stuck on the other side of it, before finding some ~luxury~ mud to coat his scales. The kobold also passed by a magical mirror that supposedly showed peoples' true beauty, but was blinded by a bright golden light. He decides to stay the night in the abandoned, formerly gang-operated store.

Walks and Vahn decide to get lodgings in a luxury hotel familiar to Walks. Upon arrival, they realize that there is an executive function for Mountain Sound occurring in the hotel's ballroom. 

Ver-Ik wakes up, surrounded by hooded figures.
