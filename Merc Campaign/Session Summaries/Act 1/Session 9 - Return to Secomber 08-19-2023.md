[[Session 8 - Plague Inc. 08-12-2023]]

Everyone returns to [[Secomber]] after verifying that Greenbourne was in fact freed by Avaris. Vahn and Ver-Ik return to the temple to begin making a cure for [[Lucille Vinger]]'s disease. [[Jerome Vinger]] tells the party more about his dealings with the Zhentarim and how he owed them a LOT of money after the bees disappeared and mead production slowed. Him and Lucille were likely in danger, evidenced by the goblin mercenaries sent after them. Derek the Cleric offers to heal Vahn's depleted health, but will need the gemstone component of Greater Restoration to do so. After learning of the danger her husband put her in for money, she gives Derek her wedding ring to use and leaves as soon as her disease was cured. With his wife gone, Jerome agrees to guide the party to where he would meet with his Zhent dealers.

They also find that the robbery they committed previously was currently being investigated. Vahn offered to help in any way he could before leaving the town.
