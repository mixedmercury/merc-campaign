[[Session 5 - Rurem and Knak 07-22-2023]]

The party enters [[Haldfeather Keep]] to find kenkus guarding it inside. They eliminate the kenkus in their way, finding living quarters and a seemingly bottomless elevator shaft. Rhys separates and goes down the hall to find two cockatrices chained up in a room with several cages. He avoids petrification and manages to singlehandedly tear both of them apart, far exceeding everyone's expectations (DM included).

A woman is in one of the cages, asking to be released, but the party does not trust her and leaves her there for now.

Further down the hall, the party sees some kenkus standing guard at a door. Using his wonderful performance skills, feathers from a dead kenku, and his plague doctor mask, Vahn pretends to be a kenku to get close. He gets close enough that by the time the kenkus see him, everyone has time to prepare for the loud footsteps growing closer. The party makes quick work of the owlbear that emerges, getting through the encounter with hardly a scratch. 

They make their way to the deepest part of the keep, finding it is the quarters of the woman they had been searching for. She reveals herself as [[Avaris the Hag]] to everyone. She proposes a deal to the party. In exchange for freeing the souls of Greenbourne and not continuing her magical draining of Vahn's health, the party would kill the warlock [[Rauthik]] in the Star Mounts. She explains that a soul as evil as his would have an extremely high value, but he has been using magic to ward her advances.

Walks suggests that the party should just kill Avaris and save themselves the hassle. Avaris responds with a little attempted murder as a warning. Seeing her easily down Walks and already being fairly exhausted from the hag's minions, the party agrees to her deal.

After Avaris fades away they scour the ruins for loot. In one of the living quarters, Rhys discovers a strange stone rod under one of the beds. When he presses the button on the bottom it stays in the air in its place and seems to vibrate. It turns out to be an immovable rod whose magic is getting a little unstable with age and wear. 

The party then kicks barrels down the elevator shaft. Walks hears a ghostly voice in their head sternly saying "Do not kick the barrels into the launch bay!" in an almost defeated voice.
