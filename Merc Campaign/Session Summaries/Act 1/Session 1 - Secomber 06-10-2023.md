(The numbers of past sessions will be estimated until later)

Walks Under Bright Moons, Rhys, Skoddit, Elq, Vahn, and Ver-Ik are all in The Seven-Stringed Harp, a tavern in [[Secomber]]. The Greengrass Festival was about to begin, yet the town seemed to be short on its signature mead for it. The barkeep, Cliff, asked the group of random strangers to go retrieve the delayed shipment from the [[Feux Volant Meadery]].

While in the tavern, Walks is attempting to pickpocket civilians, but gets caught by an [[Elf Woman]] who calls her a "filthy cat". Oh if only we knew what had been started that day. They agree to go get the shipment on the terms of Cliff not escalating the situation by getting the law involved.

Elq enthusiastically agrees, dragging the nearest creature along with him, which just so happened to be Rhys. After a brief argument, Rhys decides to go anyways. Ver-Ik meekly decides to go, who really knows why. Skoddit goes because he wants booze. Vahn tags along because he thinks this is definitely going to be interesting.

Upon leaving the village, the party encounters a small group of emerald colored kobolds led by [[Kad Hilth]] being harassed by the town guard. The guards believe they are only going to cause trouble if let in, while the kobolds insist they are peaceful and only here to gather wisdom for their lady [[Yriss]]. They successfully notice that Ver-Ik is a disguised kobold underneath his robes. The party convinces the guard to let them through.

Further down after passing a rather rowdy crowd, the party comes across a pile of swords on the ground. Two come to life and start attacking the players. After the fight, they claim them for themselves. Vahn obtains a [[Longsword of Minor Flame Tongue]] and Elk receives a scimitar that turns out to be cursed.

The party stops in a town called Greenbourne to rest, only to find its inhabitants acting extremely strangely. In The Drab Twig they find that multiple of the residents have fatal wounds. They investigate further to find a pile of rotting hobgoblin corpses surrounding the temple of Lathander. Inside is [[Clovis Langham]], the priest of Lathander and mayor of the town. The party discovers he made a deal with an old woman to "save the souls of his citizens". He did not ask the cost before foolishly agreeing. He soon found they were all already dead by the time he made the deal. The woman just bound their souls to their corpses after the fact. His god, in his hatred for the undead, had abandoned Clovis for making such a deal. He says she headed to the west after departing. The party says they'll go pursue this woman before convincing Clovis to return to Secomber, as staying in Greenbourne would not help his people.

In the town, the party encounters [[Quinn Redhelm]] as well. She presents herself as a guard of the Lord's Alliance. Quinn says the meadery seems to have been up to some shady business lately, but she doesn't have enough evidence to act. She would investigate it herself, but they'd get rid of any evidence if they saw her coming. Quinn asks the players to retrieve their business ledger for her.

The party is now Level 2.
