[[Session 11 - Bed Beholders & Beyond 09-02-2023]]

The party arrives at the guard barracks where they meet with [[Quinn Redhelm]] as planned. She introduces them to her uncle, [[Lord Redhelm]]. Walks recognizes him as the head of a rival mining business located in Waterdeep. He explains that his son [[Darian Redhelm]] has gotten mixed up with the Zhentarim, which is why Quinn had taken a particular interest in them as of late.

Though there is a safer route to Skullport that city officials can use, Quinn explains that they can't use it in case any Zhentarim spies see them heading down. She guides them to the entrance to the Underdark. On their path they encounter some Grell, swiftly defeating them after someone gets carried off by it. 

Next, they discover a cave full of Kua-Toa chanting in front of a statue of a giant purple worm. A dead mind flayer lays on the altar before it. The party decides to hold back and not interfere. Suddenly, a giant purple worm rushed through the cave, devouring all of the Kua-Toa. Only a tentacle from the mind flayer and a fragment of the head priest's staff remained. Ver-Ik saw the fragment (later the [[Branch of the Forest]]) as a capable druid wand and took it.

The mind flayer tentacle dripped with silvery blood. The party realized this blood looked exactly like the thick liquid from the [[Silver Vials]] they found at the meadery. 

Arriving at Skullport, the party goes to the Bat's Roost after looking around the black markets some. Inside, giant bats in cages are fighting while the audience placed bets on them. The party notices someone seeming to rig the fight. They chose to let him rig it, even placing the odds in his favor. Because of this, the reward on the underdog was much higher. Before it won, they made the person rigging the fight break his spell. It turned out his bat was actually a man polymorphed into one, and they lost the fight. The party got a LOT of money from this.
