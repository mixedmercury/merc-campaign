[[Session 5 (Scarecrows)]]

The party follows large stone signs along the road to the mysterious keep. They walk for hours. Long enough to need to set up camp again. Strange occurrences happen while Rhys takes watch. Whenever he looks away from the fire, it puts itself out, but reignites when he looks back at it. Something keeps soiling his... well he doesn't wear pants... fur. Strange noises echo through the woods. He tries to wake Skoddit by telling him "Wake up, the fire's dancing and I'm wet."

Skoddit promptly goes back to sleep.

In the morning Walks and Ver-Ik forage for food. They find berries in the wild, but are disgusted when they find they strangely taste like fish. They decide fish flavored fish is better than fish flavored berries and catch some to eat. They go for a bite aaaand... berries... and Rhys' fur is soiled again... Everyone's getting a bit fed up.

They continue down the path, eventually realizing it seems to be going for much longer than it should. A quick check makes them realize they've been walking in circles the last day! The party splits up, some staying on the path while others disappear into the trees searching for whatever is causing this. 

Vahn eventually happens across a cave with a pile of treasure inside that says "Free Treasure!" with a chest on top. His feigned lack of hesitance to reach for the treasure catches the mysterious presence off guard, enough for Walks to sneak up behind it. The rogue manages to creep up behind it to find a massive juvenile copper dragon snickering in the bushes. They spook him, causing him to shoot forward into the open with a yelp!

He laughs his butt off at the "hilarious" pranks he's been pulling on the party the last day. A copper scaled kobold jumps out of the chest on the "treasure" pile to join him. They introduce themselves as [[Rurem]] and [[Knak]]. Ver-Ik is put off by this dragon-kobold relationship on account of his racism, but Rurem explains that Knak isn't "his" kobold, they're best friends and he doesn't really want any other kobolds. Knak is nice to Ver-Ik despite his standoffishness.

A closer look at the treasure pile reveals it's mostly fake, with gold coated tin pieces and glass gems inside. Rurem is kind of self-conscious about it. As thanks for the entertainment for the day and a half, Rurem flies the party to their destination.
