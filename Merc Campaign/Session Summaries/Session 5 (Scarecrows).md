[[Session 4 (This is a Robbery)]]

The party departs from [[Secomber]] with [[Clovis Langham]] to find the woman who cursed his town. On the way they get attacked by a group of scarecrows and swarms of ravens. Ver-Ik gets carried off and they accidentally set a fire in the field they were in, but they manage to defeat the enemies and put out the fires.

The party stops in Uluvin, an otherwise unimportant crossroads town, for the night. Walks begins to realize they can hear the voices of ghosts while staying at Where the Maiden Dances and sees its namesake spirit. When asked to prove it, they have a ghost reveal secret information about Ver-Ik that it had seen. It said that his scales were a strange color ~~and that he is absolutely PACKING~~.

The party continues the next day to follow the signs posted to the abandoned dwarven keep where they'll find the woman they're looking for (I forget how they found out where they needed to go, but they did). 

There might have been some bandits on the way? I dunno I forgot.
