# Bio

A tiefling child that was abandoned on Mintarn. She considers [[Benwir]] to be her brother having found each other on the pirate island. She is a skilled thief for her age, sealing the occasional food or money for them both to live on.

When Benwir was kidnapped by drow vampire pirates to be sold as a slave, she started to steal more from higher paying targets to try to buy him back. She stole Walks' coin purse and led them on a chase through the city. They agreed to help free Benwir when she told them about why she was stealing from them. Afterwards they brought her onto their ship and took her and her brother away from Mintarn.
