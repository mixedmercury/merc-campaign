# Bio

The ex-wife of [[Jerome Vinger]]. She tended to the bees at [[Feux Volant Meadery]]. She followed the bees up Unicorn Run when they went missing due to the Cult of Tharzax, leading to her kidnapping. She was then used as a sacrifice for summoning the demon lord, but was saved by the party after she was infected with their plague.

Upon their return to Secomber, she learned that Jerome had been dealing with the Zhentarim and put them both in danger for money. She promptly divorced him and left town.
