# Bio

The second eldest of the Mountain Sound clan. Impulsive, loud, and hyperactive, he tends to be the most active of his siblings. He hates his oldest brother [[Inheritor of True Fortune (Fort)]] "Fort" for acting like he's better than him and being the next in line to inherit [[Mountain Sound Mining Company]]. Despite this though, he still acts against his other siblings in an attempt to prove he's better than them and to prove that he can run the company to his father. Desperate to prove himself, he is always trying to please his father [[Gems in the Eye of Heaven (Eye)]]. 

The party met him in Sundabar while he was travelling to attend Veramith's auction, doing his father's dirty work in an attempt to gain favor. He agreed to help the party in exchange for Walks helping to make Fort look bad. He ran his mouth too much in the city however and got kidnapped by the thieves' guild in an attempt to hold him for ransom. Ver-Ik and Ebon saved Fast from them and he left safely back to Neverwinter.
