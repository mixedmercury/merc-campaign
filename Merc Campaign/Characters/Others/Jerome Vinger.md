# Bio

The owner of [[Feux Volant Meadery]]. He distributed mead spiked with [[Silver Vials]] provided by the [[Zhentarim]] to nearby towns. When the bees disappeared and stopped producing honey, he fell behind on payments to the crime organization who sent hired goblins to intimidate him and collect. He missed them however when he followed his wife who followed the missing bees up Unicorn Run. He was kidnapped by the Cult of Tharzax at the end of the trail and rescued by the party.

Despite his reasons for his dealings being to provide his wife with better things, she divorced him when she found out he was putting them in danger for it.

He led the party to where he would meet with the Zhentarim in Skullport. Unfortunately, a zombie killed him when they discovered where the cult was. He then haunted Walks for some time afterwards.
