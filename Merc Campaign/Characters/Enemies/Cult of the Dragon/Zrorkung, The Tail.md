Zrorkung was the most fierce of all the kobold generals. While the others had their own motivations for the violence they saw, Zrorkung fought for the sake of chaos. All he wanted to see was pain and bloodshed. A heart full of rage and fueled by cruelty. He didn't just kill, he sought to inflict agony on those who faced him, taking great pleasure in their suffering. That included his own men when he saw fit. 

At Death March he fought and fought until there was no one left for him to slay. The cult's troops had all retreated, but he held his ground, slaughtering anyone that he could see. Anyone from the cult who saw him had either fled or been killed. None saw him fall, and none knew what became of him.
