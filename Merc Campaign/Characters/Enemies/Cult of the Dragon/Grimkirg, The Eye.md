A kobold general of Tiamat hailing from [[Veramith]]'s clan. He was one of [[Ver-Ik]]'s abusers long ago.

He was primarily utilized in infiltration and information gathering for the Cult of the Dragon, prioritizing stealth and subtlety over the brute force of the other generals.

He was decapitated at the battle of Death March.
