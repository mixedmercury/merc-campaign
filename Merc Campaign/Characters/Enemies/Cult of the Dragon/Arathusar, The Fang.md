# Bio

Arathusar was born under the dragon [[Bymianth]]. He was raised since he was a hatchling to fight and conquer in the name of Tiamat. After many battles survived and dominated, he was made into The Fang of Tiamat, one of the generals of her kobold troops. He was responsible for many raids in her name, including the destruction of Androm's (now [[Imra]]'s) home.

In the battle of Death March, he began to doubt Tiamat. He attempted to convince others that all the killing and death was pointless. In return, he was battered and beaten by both his own men and his fellow general, [[Tar-os, The Claw]]. He was believed to be as good as dead as the troops retreated and the Cult of the Dragon was defeated.

The disgraced general roamed the land for some time, eventually choosing a new path as the paladin [[Ebon No-Horns]]. 

At his true death at the hands of his replacement [[Nyrrinteg, the Fang]], he was reincarnated as Ebonthil. His original body was left behind. Though Ebonthil lives on with the weight of his memories, the death of Arathusar has come.
