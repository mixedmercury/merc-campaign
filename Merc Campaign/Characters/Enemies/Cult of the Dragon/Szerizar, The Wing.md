# Bio

A kobold general of Tiamat hailing from a white dragon's clan. She always seemed to be more interested in testing and perfecting his contraptions than actually advancing the Cult of the Dragon's cause. According to Drix, the cult was likely the most convenient way for her to see her creations in action.

While not the most devout servant of Tiamat, this still meant that her inventions were the cause of the bloody end for many soldiers on both sides.

When she saw that Death March was beginning to look not in the favor of the cult, she flew away on her mechanical wings. No one has seen her since then.
