# Bio

A servant of [[Veramith]], Liraac commanded a guard of her kobolds as representatives of the dragon.
She was extremely strict and held the kobolds to the standards of Veramith regardless of whether she was present or not. She ran the auction in Sundabar before the party managed to steal from it.

As punishment for her failure, she was sent to [[Nyrrinteg, the Fang]]'s post, demoted to grunt work. There she encountered the party again, being killed by Ver-Ik in battle.
