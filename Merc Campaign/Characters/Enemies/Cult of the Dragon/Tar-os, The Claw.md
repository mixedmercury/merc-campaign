# Bio

 A kobold general of Tiamat hailing from [[Tarvenis]]' clan. Physical strength was what mattered to Tar-Os. He led frontal assaults in a similar way to [[Arathusar, The Fang]], focusing on conquest and razing those who could not stand up to the holy power of Tiamat. Unlike The Fang however, he didn't do it necessarily for the sake of Tiamat. He believed only the strong had the right to survive. 
 
 During the battle at Death March, Arathusar attempted to convince him and other kobolds that the death and slaughter they were a part of was a waste and that the cult saw them as disposable. In response, they maimed his fellow general and left him to die.
 
 Being a senior officer of the cult, he was sent to observe their newer addition [[Nyrrinteg, the Fang]] at his post. During this time, the party arrived to collect Imra's things including Ebon, formerly Arathusar. He was struck down after knocking Ebon unconscious, a smile on his face as he fell to the ground believing that he had slain the traitor to the cult.
