# Bio

Bymianth was [[Arathusar, The Fang]] and [[Ebon No-Horns]]' former dragon. He is also the father of [[Nyrrinteg, the Fang]]. After Arathusar's disgrace, the Cult of the Dragon demanded a replacement. Seeing his son's cowardice at the battle of Death March, he elected him to fill the kobold's position. After Nyrrinteg had fled the battle, Bymianth personally saw to driving him out of any land he claimed as punishment for running from his duty to Tiamat. He offered the position as The Fang of Tiamat as a means of redemption. If he were to serve the cult, he could finally have claim over his own land with out Bymianth's interference.
