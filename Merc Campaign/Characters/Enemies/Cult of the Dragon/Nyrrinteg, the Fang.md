The son of [[Bymianth]], he was disgraced after failing to appear at Death March. His shame caused his father to prevent any attempt he made at gaining territory for himself. The only option given was to return to the Cult of the Dragon as its Fang to replace [[Arathusar, The Fang]], a position meant for a kobold. He did not care for the cult and its view of him as disposable, but it was a means for him to pursue his selfish desires. The dragon was entirely motivated by this lust for power, even accepting the shame of his position in its pursuit. 

He was killed in [[Session 32 - The Legacy of Arathusar 09-20-2024]] after his defeat at the hands of the newly reborn Ebonthil.
