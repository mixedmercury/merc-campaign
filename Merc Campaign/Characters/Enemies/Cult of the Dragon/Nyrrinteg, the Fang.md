# Bio

The son of [[Bymianth]], he was disgraced after failing to appear at Death March. His shame caused his father to prevent any attempt he made at gaining territory for himself. The only option given was to return to the Cult of the Dragon as its Fang to replace [[Arathusar, The Fang]], a position meant for a kobold. He did not care for the cult and its view of him as disposable, but it was a means for him to pursue his selfish desires. The dragon was entirely motivated by this lust for power, even accepting the shame of his position in its pursuit. 

Initially knocked out, the newly reborn Ebonthil gave Nyrrinteg the chance for redemption. Unable to lie in the zone of truth, his silence told Ebon everything he needed to know. The dragon was a slave to his own evil desires and he could not change that. He was killed in the lair of Androm after it was clear that he had no interest in redemption.
