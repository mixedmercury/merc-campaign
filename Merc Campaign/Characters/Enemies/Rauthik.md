# Bio

Rauthik was a warlock serving the demon lord Tharzax. His attempts to summon his lord attracted many of the insects in the region, including the bees of [[Feux Volant Meadery]]. When [[Lucille Vinger]] attempted to follow the bees, she got kidnapped and used as a sacrifice for the Cult of Tharzax in their summoning ritual. It almost succeeded when Lucille got infected with a plague, but Ver-Ik and Vahn managed to save her life and interrupt the ritual.

The party killed Rauthik at the request of [[Avaris the Hag]], who appeared to steal his soul away at the time of his death. She described him as a wicked and vile man whose evil soul would be of great value to her.
