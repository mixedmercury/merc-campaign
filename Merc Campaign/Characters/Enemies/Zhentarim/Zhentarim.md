An underground crime organization prominent in Waterdeep. 

One of their recent operations involved distributing [[Silver Vials]] around the region. The substance later identified as illithid blood, was being mixed with alcohol for more subtle distribution and drank as a drug with psychedelic effects. 

Recently, the Cult of Cyric began to gain prominence in the organization. They started by gaining control of the Zhents in Waterdeep, but eventually their control spread to the entirety of the organization. While not all the Zhentarim are in the Cult of Cyric, the cult is currently in control of the Zhentarim.
