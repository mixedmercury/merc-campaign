# Bio

The son of [[Lord Redhelm]] and cousin of [[Quinn Redhelm]]. He was previously an academic type, focusing greatly on his studies and driven by curiosity.

According to Quinn, he left to study at Candlekeep for a while a few months prior to the present. When he returned, he seemed much less good-natured and a lot more cynical. It was soon after this that he started to get involved in the Zhentarim and eventually the Cult of Cyric.

The party found him in the Church of Cyric in Skullport having just completed a ritual, but a hooded cultist teleported away with him before they could do anything.
