# Bio

A hag that cursed the village of Greenbourne through a deal with [[Clovis Langham]]. She tormented the party before they found her lair. She seems to very much enjoy the company of bird-like creatures around her.

She agreed to stop her curses on the party and release the curse on Greenbourne in exchange for a favor from the party. She had her eyes on a fairly wicked and powerful soul nearby. The warlock [[Rauthik]] was radiating evil energies that were quite valuable for someone who traded in souls as she did. His warding magic kept her from getting close, but if they could kill him, she would do as the party said.

When Rauthik was slain, she appeared and snatched his soul, placing it in her fleshy soul bag before disappearing.
