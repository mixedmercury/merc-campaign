# Bio

Walks attempted to pickpocket her in [[Secomber]] and failed. She got angry and called the tabaxi a "filthy cat". Later during the festival, Walks made another attempt to pickpocket, which ended up being the elf woman again. She once again got mad at the would-be thief.

Walks then found out that she ran the only magic shop in the town. The elf woman charged ridiculous prices, as she was unable to prove Walks tried to steal from her. Walks told Vahn, who decided to rob the shop.

Feeling unsafe now, her daughter traumatized and her shop at a loss, she moved to Waterdeep. She got hired at Quest Buy. Walks managed to pickpocket her nametag without realizing it was her. They destroyed the tag and moved on.

Later, the party saw that she was now the auctioneer in Sundabar. The auctioneer at the auction that they robbed. Things were once again not looking good for this woman. The party has not even bothered to learn her name.
