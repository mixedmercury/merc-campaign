# Bio

The current captain of the [[Scalebeard Pirates]]. He leads inspired by [[Scalebeard Salk]], his predecessor. Though not as experienced with leading or understanding all of Salk's secrets, he does what he can to try to guide his crew down a good path. He was only officially made the captain after the slaying of Salk's killer, the hydra in the Mere. While their ship may be owned by Walks, the crew listens to Drix out of respect. Drix helps to command the crew effectively, something someone unfamiliar with how kobolds run a ship may find difficult at times.

Now understanding who Salk really was as a person after finding his journals, he is devoting himself to following in his example. They have severed all ties with [[Veramith]] now and believes his crew can do real good (While still indulging in a few of the pleasures of being pirates of course).
