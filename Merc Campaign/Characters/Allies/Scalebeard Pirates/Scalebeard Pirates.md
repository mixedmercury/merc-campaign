Led by Captain [[Scalebeard Drix]], the Scalebeard pirates are a group of [[Veramith]]'s former kobolds that were left and almost all but forgotten by her after the battle at Death March. The original captain [[Scalebeard Salk]] was granted command of their ship The Sapphire Serpent after its staged "sinking" as the Sleepy Willow. According to its crew, the ship was meant to provide its crew as reinforcements at Death March, however Salk being new to navigation, kept getting "lost" on the way until they missed the battle.

Now the pirates occupy the town of [[Penrith]], having not received any orders from their dragon master in years. The town essentially sees them as the guards, not bothered by their "occupation" enough to do anything about it. After years under a greedy dragon, they have no concept of the value of money. The tax they charge Penrith's citizens and the toll for entry is far less than any regular guard would ask for. While definitely causing some of their own trouble in town, they do a fairly good job at keeping other threats out so its citizens have taken a liking to them. Upon remembering she possessed the ship, Veramith chose to auction it off where it was purchased by Walks Under Bright Moons. 

As revealed in Salk's journals, the pirates' wealth comes not from pillage, but from their captain's smart investments. As it turns out, the pirates just tended to go on adventures when a crew sails from town and not actually doing much pirating. While they had never officially separated themselves from Veramith in the years since the Cult of the Dragon's downfall, they now reject her outright after reading Salk's secrets.
