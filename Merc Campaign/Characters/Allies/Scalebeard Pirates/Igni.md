# Bio

A kobold cleric acting as the ship doctor for the [[Scalebeard Pirates]]. She is a bit less inclined for the kobold shenanigans that most others get up to, often choosing to stay in her med bay to read and study until she is inevitably needed. Igni is quite clever, a good bit more intellectual and clever than most other kobolds on the crew. That is not to say that she doesn't have some kobold tendencies however, choosing to take a more chaotic and direct approach to combat when she finds herself in battle. She absolutely does not have faith or trust in her crew to not do anything stupid and hurt themselves after all the things that she's seen.

Her patron goddess is Tamara, a wingless platinum dragon that was the goddess of life, light, mercy, and forgiveness. Some said she was the kindest and most benevolent of the draconic deities. As such Igni devotes herself to healing the injured while also preventing the undead from avoiding death when she can. 

Igni has formed somewhat of a bond with her fellow healer Ver-Ik. When she found that he gave her a fake name and that he was actually the pink kobold from Salk's story that inspired her, she pushed him to reveal himself to the others.
