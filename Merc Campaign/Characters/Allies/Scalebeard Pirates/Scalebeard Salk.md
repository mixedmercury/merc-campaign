# Bio

The first captain of the [[Scalebeard Pirates]], he was initially given command of the Sapphire Serpent by Veramith. In truth, he despised his dragon master. Salk was always a kinder soul. Years ago, he was injured gravely. He saw the medic of their tribe endure constant abuse, yet he tended the injuries of his abusers all the same. That kobold, Ver-Ik, saved his life from his injuries. His faith in his dragon was broken that day when he saw that the one tasked with prolonging their soldier's lives was the most hated of the tribe. They were disposable to her. 

When he was given the chance to get away from the dragon's lair he took it. He accepted command of the ship they would be receiving from a deal with the [[Mountain Sound Mining Company]]. When the time came for the kobolds aboard the ship to come to Death March, Salk purposefully steered the ship off its course, saying he got "lost" on the way. 

With the fall of the cult, Veramith overall forgot about the kobolds she stationed with her ship. In this time, Salk began to tell the story of the pink kobold who saved his life and how they were disposable to the dragons. Slowly, he turned his crew away from their former master. Over time, they settled in Penrith and grew their tribe. He often liked to spend time at a small shack in the Mere of Dead Men that he built to have some time to himself, just fishing and thinking. Tragically, this led to his death when a hydra came across him while he was at his spot by himself. He was swallowed whole by it, only some bones and his [[Typhoon Pistol]] left behind when found by the party.

Salk was worried about his betrayal of Veramith, and as such never officially announced it to her. His crew was oblivious as well, never fully knowing the details of his life behind the scenes. His most sensitive information was kept secret behind traps and locks of his design. He provided for the crew through his saving and investing, but still wanted them to believe that they were living on their own individual terms. Above all he wanted his crew to be free.
