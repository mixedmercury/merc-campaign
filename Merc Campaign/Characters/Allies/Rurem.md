# Bio

An immature and practical joke loving dragon. He primarily can be found around his lair in the Forlorn Hills, usually in the company of his best friend [[Knak]]. Rurem insists that Knak is his friend and does not belong to him like other dragons tend to do with kobolds. In fact, he doesn't need any other kobolds according to him. He just needs Knak by his side. The two enjoy pulling pranks on travelers passing through their home and some of the monsters living in it as well. Knak's magic, Rurem's strength, and their combined craftiness allow them to come up with plenty of clever practical jokes to subject anyone they can find to. His residence was originally an unimpressive nook in the mountains before taking part in slaying a young red dragon and taking its lair and horde for himself.

Though he mostly valued humor and entertainment, Rurem still had the draconic desire to collect riches. Prior to seizing a young red dragon's horde, he was very self conscious about his small hoard of glass gems and painted metal. 

His father Androm was believed to have been killed years ago by a raid initiated by the Cult of the Dragon. In truth, he took the identity of [[Imra]] and fled to Silverymoon. Rurem still has some contact with Imra, though not often to avoid raising suspicion. His main mission given by his father is to protect Knak, an objective passed on after a messenger of Bahamut tasked Androm with it when she was born.
