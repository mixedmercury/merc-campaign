# Bio

Knak lives out in the Forlorn Hills with her best friend, the copper dragon [[Rurem]]. The two enjoy pulling pranks on travelers passing through their home and some of the monsters living in it as well. Knak's magic, Rurem's strength, and their combined craftiness allow them to come up with plenty of clever practical jokes to subject anyone they can find to. 

Knak likes to emphasize that Rurem is not her master and that they are just good buddies. She did previously consider Rurem's father to be her master before their home was raided and destroyed. When that happened, Androm (See [[Imra]]) threw her out of his lair to safety. She flew until she smacked into a wall right outside of Rurem's lair. The two have stayed together ever since.

She uses illusion magic to hide that her scales are pink, since Androm said it needed to be kept a secret. She knows that the scales make her special somehow, but she doesn't know how. The party found out about this after she was knocked out by a red dragon attacking their lair.
