Clovis Langham was the mayor and chief priest of the town of Greenbourne. He worshipped and preached the word of the Morninglord Lathander. During a hobgoblin raid on the town, a strange woman appeared in his church offering to save the souls of his citizens. Desperate, he agreed. The woman disappeared, taking the lives of the hobgoblin raiders with her. Unfortunately, the people of Greenbourne had already been slain. The woman bound their souls to their corpses, leaving them to wander just barely clinging on to life in their mangled rotting bodies. This deal angered Lathander, causing him to 

When the party arrived in Greenbourne, he was hidden in his barricaded church. They convinced him to leave for Secomber and that they would try to help his town when they could.

In Secomber, he was taken in by the church there. He accompanied the party to find the hag that cursed his village, using his magic to prevent Vahn from succumbing to her nightmares. When the party struck a deal with the hag, he returned to Secomber.
