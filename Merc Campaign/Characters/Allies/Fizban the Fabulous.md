# Bio

Fizban the Fabulous is a strange old wizard who sometimes can be found wandering the land. He is often accompanied by six yellow canaries that he says are his friends, though he says there used to be seven. He was first seen taking an interest in Ver-Ik, also seeming to take note of Ebon while hinting at knowing his past. Suspicious, Ebon used his divine sense, but to no result.

It is later revealed that Fizban was in fact the platinum dragon god Bahamut in disguise. He guided Ebon through the afterlife before reincarnating him as one of his paladins. Only Ebon is somewhat aware of Fizban's true nature, and even then it is only a hazy idea as if it was a dream.
