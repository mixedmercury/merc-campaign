# Bio

Derek is ze Cleric of Secomber. He is a high priest in the town. Not much is known about him. He is a very large man with a larger heart, quite literally. He is known to be able to have access to some powerful spells, and will often only ask for the components required to perform the spell if it is for a good cause or a friend of the church. Sometimes, he may ask a donation to the church as compensation for the spell.
