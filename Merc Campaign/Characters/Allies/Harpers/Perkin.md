# Bio
 
 One of the Harpers residing at the [[Silverymoon]] Harper House. Young, inexperienced, and immature, subtlety is not his specialty. He is the younger brother of [[Wilric]].
 
 He was first met outside the Harper House when the party first arrived at Silverymoon, loudly asking if they were there about the secret mission.
