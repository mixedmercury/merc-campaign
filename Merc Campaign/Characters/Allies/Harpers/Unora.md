# Bio

A wizard for the [[Harpers]], she stays at the Harper House in [[Silverymoon]]. Though a bit disheveled and a little deranged and maybe even a little insane, she is excellent at what she does. She specialty is transmutation used for infiltration among other arcane studies. While not useful in the field and causing her own fair share of issues at the base, her skills are useful for the Harpers.

The party met her after arriving at Silverymoon for the first time. With two of the keys to free Cyric, she began working on a method of tracking the others.

While there, she gave Ebon a potion to drink, which partially transformed him into a weird bird creature from another dimension. The potion was meant to be a substitute for traditional shape change spells that were unsuccessful for the Harpers in the past. While it wasn't fully successful since he was still on two legs, it was potent enough to cause him to lay an egg.
