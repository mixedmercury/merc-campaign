# Bio

Wilric is one of the [[Harpers]], currently stationed as the one in charge of their [[Silverymoon]] Harper House. While in charge, he is not ranked higher than the others that stay at the base. He does not appear to be particularly intelligent, but is at least a bit more serious than his younger brother [[Perkin]].
