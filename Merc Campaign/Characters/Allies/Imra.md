# Bio

The owner of [[Sip the Scales]] in [[Silverymoon]]. She is an eccentric middle-aged tall, curvy elven woman with very full curly blonde hair. Imra puts off quite the bubbly and mischievous personality, while still carrying herself with some sense of experience and maturity. Above all, she seems to love to get a good laugh in. Whether it's from a simple childish prank, watching someone gamble their entire life's savings away, or making Ebon give birth, she always finds a way to work a joke in wherever she can.

The owner of the gambling house doesn't seem to care too much about gaining wealth from her business. She doesn't even seem to wince when an extremely large payout makes its way out her doors. While she does gain a considerable amount of income, she seems more interested in watching how invested people will get in the sliver of a chance of winning only to see it all whisked away in an instant.

Imra also seems to have some sort of a relationship with the copper dragon [[Rurem]] and the kobold [[Knak]]. She seems to care deeply about the safety of Knak, dropping her childish demeanor when the subject arises. When discovering the danger Rurem put her in during the incident with a young red dragon, she said "I'm swear going to beat his penny plated ass into next week." (not verbatim but I wish that's what I said on the spot lol) She is allied with the Harpers and has been housing the party in her safe room while they stayed in Silverymoon.

Upon hearing the party was going towards the Mere of Dead Men, she requested they stop at a nearby settlement to collect some things for her. While the party is doing this, she has been entrusted with the care of Ebon's egg, claiming to know about caring for kobolds. When arriving at her former residence, the party realizes that she is in fact a copper dragon. Her lair was the hiding place of one of the dragon masks before it was razed by [[Arathusar, The Fang]].

She reveals when they return that Imra was their former mate, and they took her form so that she could live on after being killed in the Cult of the Dragon's raid. Their true form is Androm, an ancient copper dragon and the father of Rurem. During the raid, he threw Knak far away to the safety of Rurem's den before faking his death and has lived as Imra ever since. While initially angry to find out that Ebon was in truth the kobold that raided her village, she trusted in Bahamut's judgement to let him live in his reborn form.
