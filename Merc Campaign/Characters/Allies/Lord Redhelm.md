Lord Redhelm is the father of [[Darian Redhelm]]. He owns and operates Hillsong Mining Company, the rival company of [[Mountain Sound Mining Company]]. Ever since his son got wrapped up in dealings with the Zhentarim, he had been determined to rescue him. He had even requested the assistance of his niece, the Harper [[Quinn Redhelm]].

After sending Quinn and the party into the Underdark to pursue the leads they found on the Zhentarim and the Cult of Cyric. After they returned following Darian's escape, Redhelm was assassinated in front of the party. With no other possible suspects and the presence of a member of the Clan Mountain Sound, the party was framed for his murder.
