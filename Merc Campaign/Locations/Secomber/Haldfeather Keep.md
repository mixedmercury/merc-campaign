An abandoned dwarven keep in the forlorn hills. Previously a modest establishment for dwarven mining and worship, it has since been taken as a base of operations for [[Avaris the Hag]]. 

Near the living quarters is an elevator that extends down into the mines. Some say they can still hear the haunting voice of an overseer scolding dwarves who misused company property.
