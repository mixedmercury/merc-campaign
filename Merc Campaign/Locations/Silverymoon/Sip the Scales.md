A tavern and gambling hall run by [[Imra]]. It is a loud and rowdy dwelling with gaming tables and other games of skill and chance throughout. The proprietresses finds it quite amusing to watch her patrons gamble their livelihoods away.

Two slabs of meat are raised high on the ceiling. Anyone who can jump and slap both of them unaided by magic gets drinks on the house for the night. If they miss they have to buy a round for everyone. If someone refuses, Imra smugly replies "Aw, are the steaks too high?"

In the back, a trapdoor activated by a switch under the bar leads to a modest safe house. The room is also accessible via the dwarven tunnels under the city, its entrance hidden by illusory magic.
